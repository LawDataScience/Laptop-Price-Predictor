# Laptop-Price-Predictor
I made this project using a dataset that I got off of Kaggle. The dataset has information about laptops, and I wanted to be able to predict the prices of laptops given other information about those laptops. Sort of like a fairly common price estimator feature that could be found on many websites to help users predict how much they might have to spend for a laptop given other features about the laptop. At first I thought that a linear regression model would work the best because I expected that as more cpu, gpu, weight, etc. were added the price would scale linearly with the additional features. However, the regression model did very poorly to accurately predict the price of the laptops. I then visualized the data, something I should have done from the start, and realized that the data had natural clusters around two, four, and eight due to the gpu being in increments of two. I then felt that an algorithm like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) would be a much better suited algorithm for this particular project. So I added another file for KNN and implemented it on the same dataset. This implementation did better with a percent error of about 30-40%. Still not perfect, but better than before. To try and improve the prediction of the model further I feel that a neural network should be implemented. I would like to work on other projects for now, so that might be a project in the future.
